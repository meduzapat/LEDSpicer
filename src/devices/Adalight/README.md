# Adalight quickstart guide

# hardware I use:
- controller: [wemos d1 mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html)
- leds: ws2812 led string, [for example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32243084800.html)


## instructions:
First step is to follow the instructions at [WLED](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED)
you are then left with a wifi + usb controlled led strip.

What I do next is create a preset with leds ON but black and set it as the wled boot preset.
When I'm ok with the settings (RGB order and max brightness mostly) and the strip is properly tested I disable the wifi (it forces you to reflash wled if you have to change something)
